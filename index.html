		 		<h1>Eye Candy</h1>
				<p>Drawing attention to your exhibit is the perfect time to bring on 
				ICM <em>eye candy</em>. You want your demographic to come and see your products
				or services. Our models pretty faces &amp;silhouettes will surely bring them in for
				a closer look at what you have to offer!
				<br>The attention your exhibit gets is exactly 
				what you need in a large car show. It will help establish your company and get your 
				brand on the map. That is why making the best presentation possible is so important in such a venue.

				<h4><i><q>You might think all car show girls are the same.</q></i></h4>
				 <p>That is simply not the case.Depending on your target market, you can select a model
				    that will match your product lines.For example, let's say your company offers aftermarket parts for exotic cars. 
					<b>Which would you choose: an exotic beauty or an All-American girl? </b>
					While the All-American girl might work, the exotic beauty would be a better fit for your
					target market. This is just an example of how you can pick the right model for your products.

					If you want to bring in girls for your next car show, the best solution is to find a 
					reputable agency that has the talent you need. It is important to work with an agency 
					that have plenty of girls with experience at car shows. They will give you the intelligent 
					minds and pretty faces you want to help showcase your company and its products. <strong>Bring out 
					the girls when you want to grab attention and bring visitors into your car show exhibit.</strong></p>
